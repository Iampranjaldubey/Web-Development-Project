        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>This website allows users to input a matrix of any dimension and calculate its LDU (Lower Diagonal Upper) factorization. The website will display the factorization process step by step, showing the L, D, and U matrices that result from the decomposition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to help users understand the concept of matrix factorization, specifically LDU decomposition, by providing a clear and interactive tool for performing the factorization step by step.</p>

        <h2> LDU Factorization Explanation</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>What is LDU Factorization?</h3>
            <p>LDU factorization decomposes a square matrix A into three matrices: L (Lower), D (Diagonal), and U (Upper), such that <br>A = L * D * U.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
            <p>LDU factorization is widely used in numerical methods, solving systems of linear equations, and matrix operations.</p>
